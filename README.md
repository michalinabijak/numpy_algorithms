# Numpy imnplementation of a couple of ML Algorithms
- [x] kNN
- [x] 3 Layer MLP (ReLU & Softmax activations), Cross-Entropy Loss
- [x] Least Squares
- [x] Winnow
- [x] One-vs-One and One-vs-All Kernel Perceptron



## Additional Functions
- [x] random train/test split
- [x] Cross Validation
- [x] Gram Matrix (for polynomial and Gaussian kernels)

TODO: change output type from error rate to prediction
