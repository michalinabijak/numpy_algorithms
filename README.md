# Numpy implementation of some ML Algorithms
This repo contains a numpy from-scratch implementation of some ML algorithms, initially designed for the MNIST Digit classification task (~3% error, averaged over 20 runs of 5 fold cross-validation)

- [x] kNN
- [x] 3 Layer MLP (ReLU & Softmax activations), Cross-Entropy Loss
- [x] Least Squares
- [x] Winnow
- [x] One-vs-One and One-vs-All Muliticlass Kernel Perceptron
- [x] logistic regression with AdaGrad optimiser
- [ ] SVM (primal + dual)



## Additional Functions 
files: CV.py and helper_functions.py
- [x] random train/test split
- [x] Cross Validation
- [x] Gram Matrix (for polynomial and Gaussian kernels)
- [x] numerical gradient check

TODO: change output type from error rate to prediction
